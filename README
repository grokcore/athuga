# Athuga
A RESTful powered, drop in, threaded, OAuth login (Facebook,Wwitter,G+), comment system.

Athuga allows you to place a script tag into any page to enable to add a comment system.
Currently the RESTful interface is a mashup of two of the best repo's I've found, the SlimeFramework and RedBean.  It also includes HybridAuth I aim to bring Node support, Python and Ruby as well, in that order.

## Requirements
PHP5.3+
MySQL

## How to use
In your location of choice on your web server.
git clone https://github.com/grokcore/athuga.git
Configure your database settings in rest/config.php.   (Your tables will be created with the first comment submitted).

Create a web page that loads either zepto or jQuery, and place this script tag where you want the comments to appear:
>         <script src="athuga.js.php"></script>
(optionally of course, set the absolute path for the athuga.js.php source.)
